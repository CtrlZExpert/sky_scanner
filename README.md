# sky-scanner

Sky Scanner is a command-line tool (CLI) that will fetch and display the current weather for a given city. It retrieves weather information from an external API and presents it in a simple format. This is my first project to practice using C for a real-world application.

## Goals

- Learn to work with external APIs using C.

- Implement basic JSON parsing and HTTP requests.

- Gain experience handling user input and errors.

- Memory management for dynamic data.

## Planned Features

- Fetch current weather for any city worldwide.

- Display:

    - Temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit)

    - Weather condition (e.g., "Clear Sky")

    - Humidity

    - Wind speed

- Handle invalid inputs or failed network requests gracefully.
